# invite-sender
Laravel &amp; jquery, allows for the upload of JSON file containing lat long coordinates of contacts. If any of the contacts are within a given distance (as the crow flies, taking curvature of Earth into consideration) then an email is sent to the given Users. The sending of the emails is mocked, for now, but is trivial to insert this functionality in the EmailSender Service.
